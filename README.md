## Requirements

The server has no requirements besides Python itself. The `requirements.txt` file is thus empty.

## Running the server

```sh
# assuming python version 3.8 or above, the server can be run with:
python server.py
```

## Running the client

A REST client is provided with this solution. Running `python client.py` will send each of the three example JSON files, one after the other, and print the result.
